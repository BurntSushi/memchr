# The 'std' feature permits the memchr crate to use the standard library. This
# permits this crate to use runtime CPU feature detection to automatically
# accelerate searching via vector instructions. Without the standard library,
# this automatic detection is not possible.
std = ["alloc"]

# The 'alloc' feature enables some APIs that require allocation, such as
# 'Finder::into_owned'. Note that this feature does not enable runtime CPU
# feature detection. That still requires 'std'.
alloc = []

# When enabled (it's disabled by default), the `log` crate will be used to
# emit a spattering of log messages. For the most part, the log messages are
# meant to indicate what strategies are being employed. For example, whether
# a vector or a scalar algorithm is used for substring search. This can be
# useful when debugging performance problems.
#
# This is disabled by default.
logging = ["dep:log"]

# The 'use_std' feature is DEPRECATED. It will be removed in memchr 3. Until
# then, it is alias for the 'std' feature.
